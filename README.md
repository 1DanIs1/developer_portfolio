# <Developer Portfolio>

## Description

I wanted to create a deployed portfolio of my work samples,
so that potential employers can review samples of my work and 
assess whether I'm a good candidate for an open position.

I gained a grreater understanding of how HTML and CSS work together and some of the style
capabilities of CSS.

## Usage

This project is used to demonstrate what I have learnt in introductory HTML and CSS. At this stage it is only for use by bootcamp marking staff, however it will be added to in the future to act as a real portfolio in the future.
